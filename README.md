 Lab 01 - MEP - the Game

A game of Renju is played on 19x19 board by two players. One player uses black stones and the
other player uses white stones. The game begins on an empty board and two players alternate in
placing black stones and white stones. Black always goes first. There are 19 horizontal and 19
vertical lines on the board, and the stones are placed on the intersections of the lines.

Horizontal lines are marked 1,2,…19 from up to down, and vertical lines are marked 1,2,…19
from left to right as shown on Figure 1.

The objective of this game is to put five stones of the same color consecutively along a horizontal,
vertical and diagonal line. So, black wins in Fig. 1. But, a player does not win the game if more than
five stones of the same color were put consecutively.
